# trusty is used to let us use docker. This isn't possible in the container
# based infrastructure. Docker is used to speed up the dapple installation,
# which can run to ~4m using npm install.
#
# The trusty infrastructure does not allow caching, unlike the container based
# default. This means waiting for npm install on each run. This may change in
# the nearâ„¢ future https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/4997
